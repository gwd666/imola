The grid family focuses on providing support for the CSS Grid standard. In imola you can find 2 functions that allow you to create a new grid component. `gridPanel()` and `gridPage()`. `gridPage()` is simply a wrapper for `gridPanel()` that allows you to create a page UI element without the need of using any of the built in shiny functions.

If you're interested in more information about the full array of options in the CSS grid standard from the CSS side, I recommend [this article](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) to get you started.
